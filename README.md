# Image-Classification-Cats-and-Dogs

I built Neural Network model models to predict if the image is a cat or a dog using three techniques: ResNet, VGG16, VGG19 and Stacking for Kaggle's competition. 

The originial dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/overview.
